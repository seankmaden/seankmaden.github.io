    abstract = "{This study probes the distribution of putatively cancer-specific junctions across a broad set of publicly available non-cancer human RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets. We compared cancer and non-cancer RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project and the Sequence Read Archive. We found that (i) averaging across cancer types, 80.6\\% of exon–exon junctions thought to be cancer-specific based on comparison with tissue-matched samples (σ = 13.0\\%) are in fact present in other adult non-cancer tissues throughout the body; (ii) 30.8\\% of junctions not present in any GTEx or TCGA normal tissues are shared by multiple samples within at least one cancer type cohort, and 87.4\\% of these distinguish between different cancer types; and (iii) many of these junctions not found in GTEx or TCGA normal tissues (15.4\\% on average, σ = 2.4\\%) are also found in embryological and other developmentally associated cells. These findings refine the meaning of RNA splicing event novelty, particularly with respect to the human neoepitope repertoire. Ultimately, cancer-specific exon–exon junctions may have a substantial causal relationship with the biology of disease.}",
