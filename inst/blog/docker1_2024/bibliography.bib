  abstract  = "Computational science has been greatly improved by the use of
               containers for packaging software and data dependencies. In a
               scholarly context, the main drivers for using these containers
               are transparency and support of reproducibility; in turn, a
               workflow's reproducibility can be greatly affected by the
               choices that are made with respect to building containers. In
               many cases, the build process for the container's image is
               created from instructions provided in a Dockerfile format. In
               support of this approach, we present a set of rules to help
               researchers write understandable Dockerfiles for typical data
               science workflows. By following the rules in this article,
               researchers can create containers suitable for sharing with
               fellow scientists, for including in scholarly communication such
               as education or scientific papers, and for effective and
               sustainable personal workflows.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The analysis of large and complex biological
               datasets in bioinformatics poses a significant challenge to
               achieving reproducible research outcomes due to inconsistencies
               and the lack of standardization in the analysis process. These
               issues can lead to discrepancies in results, undermining the
               credibility and impact of bioinformatics research and creating
               mistrust in the scientific process. To address these challenges,
               open science practices such as sharing data, code, and methods
               have been encouraged. RESULTS: CREDO, a Customizable,
               REproducible, DOcker file generator for bioinformatics
               applications, has been developed as a tool to moderate
               reproducibility issues by building and distributing docker
               containers with embedded bioinformatics tools. CREDO simplifies
               the process of generating Docker images, facilitating
               reproducibility and efficient research in bioinformatics. The
               crucial step in generating a Docker image is creating the
               Dockerfile, which requires incorporating heterogeneous packages
               and environments such as Bioconductor and Conda. CREDO stores
               all required package information and dependencies in a
               Github-compatible format to enhance Docker image
               reproducibility, allowing easy image creation from scratch. The
               user-friendly GUI and CREDO's ability to generate modular Docker
               images make it an ideal tool for life scientists to efficiently
               create Docker images. Overall, CREDO is a valuable tool for
               addressing reproducibility issues in bioinformatics research and
               promoting open science practices.",

Current computational tools estimate relative RNA abundances rather than cell type proportions in tissues with varying cell sizes, leading to biased estimates. We present lute, a computational tool to accurately deconvolute cell types with varying sizes. Our software wraps existing deconvolution algorithms in a standardized framework. Using simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate how lute adjusts for differences in cell sizes to improve the accuracy of cell composition.
