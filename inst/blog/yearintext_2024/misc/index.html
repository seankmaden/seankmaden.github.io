Devil in the white city, Gary Larson -- 

Chicago in the late 19th century. A serial killer who lures and immolates their prey in a castle. Gripping and chilling, with detailed accounts of World's Fairs, Eiffel's feats of engineering, and a city at a key moment in its history.

Outliers , Malcom Gladwell -- 

From hockey, to rug cleaning, to intelligence tests, to airline tragedy. Gladwell weaves a typically captivating tale about explainable anomalies that is frequently difficult to quote.

The Tiger: A true story of vengeance and survival, John Valiant -- 

Armenian radio and the Amur tigers of Siberia. Rich with references to global media and rife related scholarship. This exceptional account of the brutality of living conditions in Siberia tracks the commingled experiences of three Russians as they grapple with lawlessness, brutal climate, savage predators, and the ones who track them. Includes accounts of border struggles and the first world tiger preserves, along with jaw-dropping details from archaeological and historical records. Readers should see also Denali by "", and MCMC.

White teeth, Zadie Smith -- 

Deals with racism, gender, poverty, and privilege. Shemale boys and lookalikes in the far mid-East.

The shards, Brian Ellis --

Horny teenagers in early 1980s Bay Area, reenvisioned through the manic lens of post-social media modern day. The protagonist is caught in the middle of a spree where the killer is murdering his classmates' pets before they are slain. Stylistic and brimming with pop culture, it is a vaporwave-saturated homage to thrillers and classic horror.

Into the abyss, Carol Sheban --

One of my top reads of this year. Begins with the amazing account of the Wapato plane crash in early 1980s Canadian wilderness from which the author's father, a Canadian diplomat, survived. Details the extensive, and often seemingly excessive, travails of the survivors and their personal struggles to make their way into life after unthinkable tragedy. An excellent book about aviation history, safety standards, and enduring personal tolls exacted by tragedy.

Wind, sand, and stars, Antoine de Saint Exupery -- 

Often poetic, occasionally visionary and charismatic. This great recount of the author's time delivering mail for the French postal service resonates with heroism, huge risk, extreme climate, and sociopolitical tension. It mostly takes place in and over France, North Africa, South America and Spain during the early twentieth century. Parts read like a convolution through the lens of either the author or a translator. A classic in aviation nonfiction.

Demon copperhead, Barbara Kingsolver --

Another highlight for me this year. Like Shakespeare set in a landfill. A tale reeking of epic struggle, inner turmoil, and football. Defies readers to see through the poverty of moral and medical judgement of drug addiction in rural Louisiana*. Entreats them to feel for the hotheaded yet surprisingly cold-blooded protagonist. Sections read like grocery store clear channel hits like scraps of the comic strip universe where Damon "Demon" Copperhead finds  artistic salvation.

Financial Freedom, Grant Sabatier --

Blogs. Side hustles. Websites that make passive income. Early retirement. Does the government just hold on to your money before giving it back? Does paying off your own debt count as a gift to yourself? This thought-provoking read is also a time capsule of the author's manifold hobbies, projects and interviews. Useful advice about compounding interest, contingencies, strategy, and nomenclature for investment noobs and finance adventurers alike.

Eighty Twenty Principle, Richard Koch --

Time and markets. Why do corporations need strategy? What factors determine company feast and famine? Entrepreneurs and networkers alike can rejoice. The collective efforts of the author's(s') team connect established ideas like the Pareto Principle to modern success stories of various types. Think like a connoisseur of strategy and begin to apply person-hours logic at scale. I appreciated the plots. Runner up for my favorite read this year.

Endurance Diet, Matt Fitzgerald --

Sports writer, journalist, and athlete provides a straightforward thesis: what do we learn about diets when we survey top athletes across sports? This was a lively meta-analysis that is to my knowledge first in class. Synthesizes many strands of advice carefully, and features amazing recipes from around the globe and even back in time. A celebration of fitness that delivered.

What I Think About When I Think About Running, --

Murakami's driven record enumerates the cold logic and gut-wrenching sacrifices that accompany an exceptional routine. Run an hour every day. Run at least a marathon a year. Write for a living. This is a personal account that dives deep into the psyche of a famous writer. It contains useful advice, practical perspective, and wisdom to learn by.

The lady drinking tea, --

Top read this year about the origins of Public health disciplines and related academic fields in the United States. Written by a theoretical physicist about historical figures in statistics and specifically the fate of Ronald Fisher. Contains surprising and gripping historical information, including the origin of LD50, the causation of lung cancer from cigarette smoke, and ... . This won ... ...

The count of monte cristo, --

... ...

Jane eyre, --

... ...
